              <h5 class="card-title">Mario</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Mario is a heroic Italian plumber, with media outside of the games depicting him from Brooklyn.[29] Mario is known for being kind, cheerful, playful, encouraging, courageous, and headstrong and is also eager and cocky in certain occasions. Officially, however, Nintendo producers have stated that Mario's biography is kept simple in order to make the character versatile and reusable in many different games and situations.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Sven</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Sven has a vibrant personality and is openly friendly to those he meets, particularly if they can offer him a carrot, as shown by his exchanges with Anna and Olaf. He is extremely curious of his surroundings and does not hesitate to give things that capture his interest a nudge, sniff, or lick, such as when he explored the chiming sounds of frozen water droplets in an icy forest. Sven also attempted to lick the staircase leading to Elsa's palace, only to have his tongue stuck to the surface.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Finn</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Finn is a kind, brave, selfless, and righteous boy. His aspirations to become a great hero makes him somewhat of a moral sheriff in the Land of Ooo, as he is willing to help and protect any innocent person or creature. Finn has a very strong sense of responsibility and becomes upset when he is unable to help others. Due to this and being somewhat simple-minded, Finn often feels conflicted when it is unclear whether something is good or evil as exemplified by his dealings with Marceline in the episode "Henchman."</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Steven</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Steven is optimistic, friendly, outgoing, soft-hearted, and carefree with a happy-go-lucky attitude that is appreciated by many of the citizens of Beach City in one way or another. He is musically inclined, a trait inherited from his father, with a propensity for breaking out into song and occasionally playing on his ukulele. Steven sees the best in everyone and is also very compassionate, something which Pearl notes he inherits from his mother and treasures his friends and family. He is friendly toward almost everyone he meets (even to his detriment), rarely holds grudges, and is non-discriminatory, never treating anyone with prejudice, even enemies. No matter the situation, Steven will always go out of his way to support his loved ones, even if it means putting his life on the line and he will avoid resorting to violence if possible. He would much rather make a compromise and choose to reason than fight back.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Jackie</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Jackie is mild-mannered, modest, humble and conservative in nature. He is cautious and does not like to take unnecessary risks, although circumstances often force him to do otherwise. Jackie is polite and respectful of others, and he is loving and patient towards his uncle and niece. When those close to him are hurt, he often experiences anger and strikes out against his enemies. He is fiercely protective of Jade, demanding that she stay back on missions as they are "too dangerous." Although resourceful and well educated in regards to history and martial arts, Jackie can be too trusting of others, which often leads to trouble. He is generally optimistic and mellow, although when things grow dire he has shown incredible decisiveness.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">SpongeBob SquarePants</h5>
              <p class="card-text">SpongeBob is a fun-loving, hyperactive, clueless, and childish sea sponge with a happy-go-lucky personality. Despite being portrayed this way, he is relatively smart and knows right from wrong, an example being telling Patrick not to draw his picture of calling Mrs. Puff a "big, fat, meanie" because she's a teacher. He is extremely determined and will often stop at nothing to accomplish a task. He is also somewhat dramatic to the people who are kind to him: for example, to the mailfish.[20] He is also over-confident. Sometimes, though, he shows his devious side when trying to get Mr. Krabs and Plankton to work together.[21] He sometimes makes mountains out of molehills, such as losing his name tag.[22] It is also suggested that he deceived the Tattletale Strangler in an elaborate plot to get him back to jail. When he first met Plankton, he was almost quick to befriend him, but quickly realized Plankton's true intention was to take advantage of him to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. Plankton himself is surprised that SpongeBob was smart enough to see through his manipulation, telling him, "Gee, and I thought you were stupid."</p>

                <p class="card-text">Carl is quite greedy, loving to devour not only food but objects such as toys and newspapers. When his parents expanded their cable line-up, Carl found himself focusing on a channel devoted to llamas and a show about a superhero called Llama Boy, the Super Hero. He has adored llamas ever since, going so far as to join a fan club, the Llama Love Society (which he likely created, since he has shown to be the only member). He even turned into a llama once. He is allergic to almost everything and has asthma. Carl often unknowingly gives Jimmy his brilliant ideas.</p>
